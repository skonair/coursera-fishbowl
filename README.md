# coursera-fishbowl
As part of my coursera course 'Responsive Website Development and Design Capstone' I create a meteor application called "global fishbowl". During time of the course, this repository will be closed for changes from other people.

To run the application, simply install meteor and run the application:
```
$ meteor
```

## Known issues:

* Chrome (since version 50) doesn't allow geolocation requests from http connections. So testing with a mobile device is a bit tricky, when you don't have an ssl proxy.
* The design of the logo and other buttons is still... lets say immature.
* The fishlist is not integrated in the spot-information area and is still not well designed.
* The buttons on the spot information are reactive, the people in the spot aren't yet.
* The crowdedness and cleanliness buttons can be disabled; so no real radio-button type yet.
