# coursera-fishbowl
As part of my coursera course 'Responsive Website Development and Design Capstone' I create a meteor application called "global fishbowl". During time of the course, this repository will be closed for changes from other people.

To run the application, simply install meteor and run the application:
```
$ meteor
```
