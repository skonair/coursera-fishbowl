# coursera-fishbowl
As part of my coursera course 'Responsive Website Development and Design Capstone' I create a meteor application called "global fishbowl". During time of the course, this repository will be closed for changes from other people.

To run the application, simply install meteor and run the application:
```
$ meteor
```

## Known issues:

* Chrome (since version 50) doesn't allow geolocation requests from http connections. So testing with a mobile device is a bit tricky, when you don't have an ssl proxy.
